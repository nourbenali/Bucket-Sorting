# Bucket-Sorting

iven an integer k, we have to sort with the "bucket sort" positive integers
or null integers having at most k digits.
We suppose that the positive or null data are written in decimal writing
with at most k digits, in other words that the data are less than 10
to the kth power.
We use a table, called "bucket" table, indexed by 0, 1, ...., 9. The table
is called bucket. The buckets are: bucket[0], ..., bucket[9]. Each of the
bucket is a structure containing two pointers intended to contain the
addresses of the beginning and the end of a chained list of integers, a list which will be said to be
"contained" by the corresponding bucket.
The algorithm proceeds as follows:
- We chain the data: let L be the obtained list.
- For i which varies from 1 to k :
- We initialize all the bucket addresses to NULL.
- We take one by one the nodes of L. For each node m :
- we note n the data contained in the node m
- we note num the ith digit of n from the right (for example, if i is
for example, if i is 1, num is the units digit of n)
- we chain the node m at the end of the chained list contained by
bucket[num]. We update accordingly the two
pointers of baquet[num].

- We reconstitute a list L by chaining "end to end" the contents of
baquet[0], then baquet[1], ..., then baquet[9].

This was developed in C language.
